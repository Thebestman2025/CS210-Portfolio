# CS210-Portfolio
This project, CS210-Portfolio, was developed as part of my coursework in CS 210. It focuses on solving Create an executable code that reads “Hello, World!” in C++ (Visual Studio) and runs without errors and creating a new empty Visual Studio project from an empty C++ source file,  and then copy the C++ code from the provided Calculator.cpp file. The program perform a wide variety of tasks depending on its general-purpose programming language that is  System Programming. C++ is often used for system-level tasks like operating systems, drivers, and embedded systems. Example: Developing a file system, memory management, or device drivers. Data Processing- C++ programs can handle large amounts of data and perform operations such as sorting, searching, and transformation. Example: A program to process and analyze a CSV file. Game Development-C++ is a popular choice for game engines and high-performance graphics. Example: Creating 2D or 3D games using libraries like SFML, Unreal Engine, or DirectX. Mathematical and Scientific Computation - Programs can perform complex mathematical operations or simulations. Example: Solving equations, running physics simulations, or analyzing statistics.
Software Development - Used to develop applications such as GUI programs, web servers, and desktop software. Example: Building a calculator app, a text editor, or a chat application.
C++ is highly versatile, supporting different paradigms like procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. Here's a breakdown of what C++ programs typically do:. This project showcases my ability to write efficient, maintainable, and well-documented C++ code.

Reflection
Project Summary
This project solves the problem of [specific problem or goal]. By [explain approach or method], it ensures [desired outcome].

Strengths in the Project
One of the strengths of this project was my ability to implement complex sorting algorithm (e.g., QuickSort or MergeSort) that efficiently handled large datasets. This demonstrates my ability to apply algorithmic concepts to solve real-world problems effectively.I focused on writing clean and well-documented code by using descriptive variable names, modular functions, and detailed comments. This made the program easier to understand and maintain.I effectively used debugging tools like GDB or integrated debugging features in my IDE to identify and resolve issues quickly, reducing development time and improving program reliability.


Transferable Skills
Through this project, I gained skills in  understanding of C++ functions, debugging, or working with data structures. These skills will be highly valuable for future coursework, personal projects, or professional goals.

Program Maintainability
I made the program maintainable by:

Using clear and descriptive variable and function names.
Writing detailed comments to explain the logic.
Structuring the code with modular functions.
These steps ensure that the program is easy to read, debug, and adapt.
